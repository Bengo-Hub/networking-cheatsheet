## End-User Networking

### 6.1 Home Networking

**Home Network Components:**

- **Router/Gateway**: Connects home network to internet
  - NAT/PAT
  - DHCP server
  - Firewall
  - Wireless access point

- **Switch**: Connects wired devices (if router has limited ports)
- **Access Point**: Extends wireless coverage (if needed)
- **Range Extenders**: Amplify wireless signal
- **Mesh Systems**: Multiple nodes for coverage

**Home Network Setup:**

1. Internet connection (DSL, cable, fiber)
2. Router configuration
   - Change default passwords
   - Update firmware
   - Configure Wi-Fi security (WPA3)
   - Set up guest network
3. Device connection
4. Network testing

**Home Network Security:**

- Strong Wi-Fi passwords
- WPA3 encryption
- Firmware updates
- Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
- Guest network isolation
- Firewall enabled
- Disable remote management (if not needed)

### 6.2 Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)

**SOHO Network Features:**

- Basic routing and switching
- VPN connectivity (site-to-site or remote access)
- Basic QoS for VoIP
- Network storage (NAS)
- Print server
- Basic security (firewall, antivirus)

**SOHO Considerations:**

- Scalability: Plan for growth
- Reliability: Backup internet connection
- Security: Enterprise-like security on smaller scale
- Cost: Balance features and budget

### 6.3 Mobile and Wireless End-User Networking

**Mobile Network Connectivity:**

- **Cellular**: 4G LTE, 5G connections
- **Wi-Fi**: Connection to wireless networks
- **Bluetooth**: Short-range device connections
- **Hotspot**: Sharing cellular connection

**Mobile Device Management (MDM):**

- Device enrollment
- Policy enforcement
- App management
- Security compliance
- Remote wipe capability

**Personal Area Networks (PANs):**

- Bluetooth: Device pairing, file transfer, audio
- NFC (Near Field Communication): Short-range contactless
- Wi-Fi Direct: Device-to-device Wi-Fi

### 6.4 Internet of Things (IoT) Networking

**IoT Connectivity:**

- **Wi-Fi**: High bandwidth, power consumption
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Low power, short range
- **Zigbee**: Mesh networking, low power
- **Z-Wave**: Home automation, low power
- **LoRaWAN**: Long range, low power
- **Cellular IoT**: LTE-M, NB-IoT

**IoT Security Challenges:**

- Weak default credentials
- Unencrypted communication
- Lack of update mechanisms
- Large attack surface
- Privacy concerns

**IoT Best Practices:**

- Network segmentation
- Strong authentication
- Regular updates
- Monitoring and logging
- Encryption in transit and at rest
